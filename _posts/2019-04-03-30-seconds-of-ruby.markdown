## 30 Seconds of Ruby

Early February, while browsing the latest Product Hunt upvotes, I came across a very interesting looking project called [30 Seconds of Knowledge](https://www.producthunt.com/posts/30-seconds-of-knowledge).

This browser extension provides you with a random code snippet from 6 available categories every time you open a new tab that you can read and understand in 30 seconds or less.

That's great I thought, visited the website, added the extension to my browser and with the first new open tab I had the first snippet in front of me.

First I was surprised that I could not find any Ruby support. Soon I realised This is a great opportunity to re-visit some of Ruby's core methods, learn about the latest syntax introductions of Ruby as well as to contribute to an amazing open source project. **30-Seconds-of-Ruby** was born.

After about a week [petrovicstefanrs](https://github.com/petrovicstefanrs) the owner of the 30-seconds-of-knowledge Github repo merged the provided ruby snippets.

It's great to see my contribution in action every time which allows everyone learning about Ruby in easy, digestible bits.
