## What will my blog posts be about?

Welcome to the personal blog of Florian Josef Reheis. I will share interesting and helpful information about various areas, mainly Ruby on Rails. My goal is not to win the next Pulitzer Prize, more I'm documenting the my journey as a Developer and the related information I came across. I also want to include my experiences and the way how to adapt all of it in your daily business.

Drop me a line to discuss the newest trends over a coffee.
Stay tuned!

Florian
